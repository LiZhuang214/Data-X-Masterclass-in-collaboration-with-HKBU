## üìù Notes

* The `"private": true` setting in package.json will be respected and the package won't be published to npm.
* You can use `src.pushRepo` option to set an alternative url or name of a remote as in `git push <src.pushRepo>`. By default this is `null` and  `git push` is used when pushing to the remote.
