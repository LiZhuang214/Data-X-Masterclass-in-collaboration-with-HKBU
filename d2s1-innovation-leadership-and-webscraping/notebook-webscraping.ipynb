      "          This course is designed primarily for upper-level undergraduate engineering and technical students. Graduate students at a mezzanine level can also take a co-located section of the course. The course material offers an understanding at the intersection of foundational math mathematical concepts and current computer science tools, with applications of real world problems.  Math concepts include filtering, prediction, classification, decision-making, entropy as part of information theory, LTI systems, spectral analysis, and frameworks for learning from data.  Computer science tools for this course include open source tools such as Python with Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, SQL, NLTK, Tensor Flow, and Spark.  The course includes a team based data application project.\n",

      "          The lectures present alternating and related topics between mathematical frameworks and the same concept within code examples. One goal is that students who understand math concepts can bring them to life with scalable CS tools.  And, students who are comfortable with computer software code can create systems by understanding selected, structured mathematical frameworks. This course is designed to be more applied than a traditional ML algorithms course as it includes a systems view and covers implementation concepts.\n",

      "         <p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n",
      "          Applications of this course are broad.  They include industry sectors such as finance, health, engineering, transportation, energy, and many others.  The lab section of the course meets in parallel with the lecture.  In the lab, the first 4 weeks are used to generate a story and low-tech demo for a real-world project that performs actions on data, and the following 8 weeks will be an agile sprint, with a demonstration of working project code by the end of the class. The skill set learned in this class can be applied to a broad range of industry sectors such as finance, health, engineering, transportation, energy, and many others.\n",
